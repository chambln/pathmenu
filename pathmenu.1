.TH "PATHMENU" "1" "December 2019"
.SH NAME
pathmenu - browse directories and select files with dmenu
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpathmenu\fR [\fIDIRECTORY\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBpathmenu\fR is a simple POSIX shell script that allows the user to
select any number of files by recursively browsing directories using
\fBdmenu\fR(1).
.PP
With no \fIDIRECTORY\fR, start in the working directory.
Selections are written to standard output.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Interactively move files (use with care):
.IP
.nf
\fC
IFS=\[aq]
\[aq] mv -i -- $(pathmenu -p Source) $(pathmenu -p Destination)
\fR
.fi
.PP
Suggest only directories:
.IP
.nf
\fC
pathmenu -d
\fR
.fi
.PP
Browse \[ti]/src/foo/, including hidden files, and edit the selected
files:
.IP
.nf
\fC
IFS=\[aq]
\[aq] $EDITOR $(pathmenu -a \[ti]/src/foo)
\fR
.fi
.PP
Configure \fBxbindkeys\fR(1) to have Super-o start pathmenu in my
home directory and open the selection in the appropriate program:
.IP
.nf
\fC
;;; ~/.xbindkeysrc.scm
(xbindkey \[aq](mod4 o) \[dq]IFS='\[rs]n' xdg-open $(pathmenu)\[dq])
\fR
.fi
.PP
See also \fBdicemenu\fR(1) for a (very) basic file manager built on
pathmenu.
